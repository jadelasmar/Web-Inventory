# Using Codex CLI on Another Computer (Temporary Guide)

Goal: Use the Codex CLI on another PC and link it to this repo.

Assumptions:
- You have access to the repo (GitHub or other remote).
- You can install tools on the other PC.
- This PC uses the npm-installed Codex CLI (codex.ps1 in npm global bin).

1) Install prerequisites on the other PC
- Git for Windows
- Node.js (LTS) + npm
- Python 3.10+ (optional; needed only if you run the app locally)

2) Install Codex CLI (same method as this PC)
Open PowerShell as your normal user:

npm install -g codex

Verify:

codex --version

3) Clone the repo
Open PowerShell:

git clone <your-repo-url> C:\Github\Web-Inventory
cd C:\Github\Web-Inventory

4) Open Codex CLI in the repo
Run Codex from the repo directory so it uses the project context:

codex

If prompted, sign in with the same account used here.

5) Optional: Keep tools consistent
- Pull latest changes if needed:
  git pull
- Install Python deps if you plan to run the app:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Notes:
- Codex CLI uses the current working directory as the project context.
- If you use a different repo path, just open Codex from that folder.

If npm isn't available, tell me what install method you prefer (winget, chocolatey, manual).
